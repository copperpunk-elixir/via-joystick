# ViaJoystick

Documentation will be added as soon as we can get to it. We're focusing on getting [Via](https://github.com/copperpunk-elixir/via) up and running right now (which uses this package as a dependency). If you would like to use a joystick with your Elixir project, visit www.copperpunk.com to drop us a line. We can surely get you on your way.

## Installation

This package can be installed by adding `via_joystick` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:via_joystick, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation (when it is written) can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/via_joystick](https://hexdocs.pm/via_joystick).
